17:35:46 [@astrojs/cloudflare] Enabling sessions with Cloudflare KV with the "SESSION" KV binding.
17:35:46 [@astrojs/cloudflare] If you see the error "Invalid binding `SESSION`" in your build output, you need to add the binding to your wrangler config file.
17:35:46 [WARN] [@astrojs/cloudflare] [@astrojs/cloudflare] This adapter is intended to be used with server rendered pages, which this project does not contain any of. As such, this adapter is unnecessary.
17:35:46 [WARN] [adapter] Cloudflare does not support sharp at runtime. However, you can configure `imageService: "compile"` to optimize images with sharp on prerendered pages during build time.

[vite]: Rollup failed to resolve import "recharts" from "/media/oem/MyFiles/8_DEVELOPMENT/Focalis-Stratega-Group/src/components/SustainabilityWidget/ImpactoVerdeComponent.jsx".

If you do want to externalize this module explicitly add it to
`build.rollupOptions.external`
